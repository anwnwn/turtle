During five years of share price growth, Naspers actually saw its EPS drop 4.7% per year.

With EPS falling, but a modestly increasing share price, it seems that the market was probably too pessimistic about the stock in the past"

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return"
"The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested"
"So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return"
"We note that for Naspers the TSR over the last 5 years was 78%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above"
"The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.
A Different Perspective

It's good to see that Naspers has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 1.1% in the last twelve months"
And that does include the dividend
"Having said that, the five-year TSR of 12% a year, is even better"
"Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders"
"While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important"
"For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Naspers (1 is concerning) that you should be aware of"
